# Architecture

A browser-based, multiplayer roguelike where the entire UI is text. Any number of
players share a persistent world. Written in TypeScript, linted with ESLint, and
designed so that all game rules are testable without a browser or a network.

---

## 1. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- **Text is the UI.** The world is rendered as a grid of glyphs (`@`, `#`, `g`, `~`)
  with a message log and status panels — classic roguelike presentation in the browser.
- **Massively multiplayer.** One shared world; the architecture must scale from
  2 players on a laptop to thousands across processes/machines.
- **Social.** Every player picks a handle and can chat — zone-local and global
  channels (§6.4).
- **Server-authoritative.** The server owns the truth; clients are terminals.
- **Testable by construction.** All game rules are pure functions in a dependency-free
  package, testable with plain unit tests — no DOM, no sockets.
- **Strict tooling.** TypeScript `strict`, ESLint (flat config) + Prettier, Vitest.

### Non-Goals (for v1)

- Graphics/tiles, sound, mobile-specific UI.
- Client-side prediction (server authority + interpolation is enough at first).
- Persistent accounts/database (in-memory first, storage added behind an interface).

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Browser
        A[Client<br/>text renderer + input]
    end
    subgraph Node.js
        B[Gateway<br/>WebSocket + sessions]
        C[Simulation<br/>tick loop, world state]
        D[(World Store<br/>in-memory → DB later)]
    end
    A <-->|WebSocket, versioned protocol| B
    B --> C
    C --> D
```

**Three npm workspaces, one source of truth:**

| Package        | Runs in | Responsibility                                                   |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@game/shared` | both    | Protocol messages, game rules (pure), types, seeded RNG, map gen |
| `@game/client` | browser | Rendering, input, networking, zero game rules                    |
| `@game/server` | node    | WebSocket gateway, authoritative simulation, persistence         |

The critical rule: **`shared` contains every game rule; `client` and `server` contain
none.** The same `shared` code runs the real game on the server and powers unit tests.

Dependency direction is strictly one-way:

```
client ──┐

server ──┘
```

Enforce it with ESLint `import/no-restricted-paths` so nobody couples the layers
by accident.

## 5. Game Model

### 5.1 World & time

- The world is a set of **zones** (maps). A zone is a 2D grid of tiles plus the
  entities on it. Zones are the unit of scaling (§8).
- **Tick-based simulation** at a fixed rate (e.g. 10 ticks/sec). Each tick:
  1. Drain the command queue (one queued command per entity per tick).
  2. Run systems in a fixed, deterministic order.
  3. Collect emitted **events** for clients.
- Roguelike "speed" is modelled with **energy**: acting costs energy; entities act
  when their energy crosses a threshold. This preserves classic turn-order feel
  (fast monsters act more often) inside a real-time loop.

### 5.2 Entities & components (data-oriented, not OOP)

Entities are plain data; behaviour lives in pure functions ("systems").

```ts
type EntityId = number;

interface Position {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  zone: ZoneId;
}
interface Stats {
  hp: number;
  maxHp: number;
  attack: number;
  defense: number;
}
interface Energy {
  current: number;
  speed: number;
}
interface Ai {
  kind: "aggressive" | "wander" | "flee";
}

interface World {
  tick: number;
  zones: Map<ZoneId, Zone>;
  entities: Map<EntityId, Entity>;
  // components stored as sparse maps keyed by EntityId:
  positions: Map<EntityId, Position>;
  stats: Map<EntityId, Stats>;
  energies: Map<EntityId, Energy>;
  ais: Map<EntityId, Ai>;
  players: Map<EntityId, PlayerSession>; // which entities are human-controlled
}

interface PlayerSession {
  handle: string; // display name, chosen at connect, unique among online players
  connectedAt: number;
}
```

This shape is deliberately boring: serializable, diffable, and trivial to construct
in a test (`makeWorld({ ... })`).

### 5.3 Rules are pure functions

Every rule has the same signature — world in, events out, no I/O, no mutation of
input, randomness only via an injected seeded RNG:

```ts
type Rule = (world: World, rng: Rng, cmd: Command) => Event[];

// examples
tryMove(world, rng, { entity, dx, dy }); // → [Moved] | [Bumped] | [Attacked]
resolveAttack(world, rng, { attacker, target });
computeFov(world, entity); // → Set<TileId>  (visible tiles)
```

Consequences:

- **Determinism**: same `world + rng seed + commands` ⇒ same result. Replay tests
  and regression tests become trivial.
- **Unit tests need no fixtures**: build a tiny world in 5 lines, call the rule,
  assert on returned events.
- The server is a thin imperative shell: sockets → queue → pure rules → broadcast.

### 5.4 Procedural generation

Map generation lives in `shared/mapgen`, seeded per zone. Given the same seed,
client and server generate identical terrain — the server can send a 4-byte seed
instead of a whole map. Algorithms: BSP or cellular automata for caves, plus
hand-authored vaults spliced in.

---

## 6. Networking Protocol

### 6.1 Transport

- One WebSocket per player, JSON messages first (human-debuggable).
- The protocol is versioned (`protocolVersion` in the hello message) so binary
  encoding (MessagePack) can be swapped in later without changing call sites.

### 6.2 Message types (discriminated unions in `shared/protocol`)

```ts
type ChatChannel = "zone" | "global";

// client → server
type ClientMessage =
  | { t: "hello"; handle: string; protocolVersion: number }
  | { t: "cmd"; seq: number; cmd: Command } // move/attack/use/quaff…
  | { t: "chat"; channel: ChatChannel; text: string }
  | { t: "ping"; clientTime: number };

// server → client
type ServerMessage =
  | { t: "welcome"; entityId: EntityId; zoneSeed: number; tick: number; roster: string[] }
  | { t: "snapshot"; tick: number; entities: EntityView[] } // full, on join/zone change
  | { t: "delta"; tick: number; changed: EntityView[]; removed: EntityId[] }
  | { t: "events"; tick: number; events: Event[] } // "You hit the goblin!"
  | { t: "chat"; from: string; channel: ChatChannel; text: string; tick: number }
  | { t: "reject"; seq: number; reason: string } // also used for invalid chat/handles
  | { t: "pong"; clientTime: number; serverTime: number };
```

- **All untrusted input is parsed with zod at the gateway.** Inside the sim,
  everything is already typed and valid.
- **Interest management:** clients only receive entities inside their field of view
  plus a margin. This is both a bandwidth optimization and an anti-cheat
  (no wallhack data on the wire).
- **Snapshots + deltas:** full snapshot on join and zone change; per-tick deltas
  otherwise. Events drive the client's message log.
- Client sends commands with a sequence number; server acks implicitly by applying
  them or explicitly via `reject`.

### 6.3 Client-side flow

```
keypress → input/ → Command → net/ ──WS──▶ server
server ──WS──▶ net/ → interpolation buffer (render 1–2 ticks behind)
                   → render/ (glyph grid, log, status)
```

Render loop (`requestAnimationFrame`) is decoupled from network ticks; entity
positions interpolate between the last two snapshots so 10 ticks/sec still looks
smooth.

### 6.4 Chat

Chat is a first-class feature, but it is **not a game rule** — it never touches
the simulation or world state. The gateway relays chat messages directly
connection → connection, which keeps the sim deterministic and means chat load
can never slow down the tick loop.

- **Handles**: chosen in the `hello` message. The gateway validates: 1–16 chars,
  `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`, unique among currently online players (case-insensitive).
  Invalid or taken handles get a `reject` and the client re-prompts. Handles are
  ephemeral in v1 (tied to the connection); account-bound handles arrive with
  persistence.
- **Channels**: `zone` reaches players in your current zone; `global` reaches
  everyone online. The channel type is in the protocol, so adding `party` or
  `whisper` later is a server change only, not a protocol break.
- **Abuse controls** (all at the gateway edge):
  - token-bucket rate limit per connection (e.g. 1 msg/sec, burst 4);
  - hard max length (240 chars), enforced by the zod schema;
  - clients render chat via `textContent`, never `innerHTML` — no HTML/JS
    injection is possible by construction. Enforced by an ESLint rule
    (`no-unsanitized/property` on the log renderer).
- **History**: the gateway keeps the last ~50 messages per channel in memory and
  includes them in `welcome`-adjacent catch-up so joiners see recent context.
  No persistence.
- **Display**: chat interleaves with game events in the message log, prefixed
  and color-coded — `<handle>` in one color for zone, another for global, while
  game events stay un-prefixed.

---

## 7. Server Architecture

### 7.1 Processes and seams

v1 runs everything in **one Node process**, but the code is split at seams that
allow horizontal scaling later:

```
Gateway (I/O)  ──commands──▶  Simulation (pure-ish core)  ──▶  WorldStore (interface)
     ▲                                                             │
     └──────────── snapshots/deltas/events ◀───────────────────────┘
```

- **Gateway**: owns sockets, session lifecycle, handle validation, zod
  validation, per-connection rate limits, chat relay (§6.4 — bypasses the sim
  entirely), backpressure (drop deltas, never drop events).
- **Simulation**: owns the tick loop and the world; single-threaded by design
  (one zone = one logical thread of execution — no locks anywhere).
- **WorldStore**: interface with an in-memory implementation now; Redis/Postgres
  implementation later for persistence and cross-process hand-off.

### 7.2 Tick loop

```ts
setInterval(() => {
  const cmds = commandQueue.drain(); // validated commands from gateway
  const rng = Rng.forTick(world.tick, seed); // deterministic per tick
  const events = stepWorld(world, cmds, rng); // shared: run all systems in order
  const views = buildInterestViews(world); // per-player visible state
  gateway.broadcast(views, events);
}, TICK_MS);
```

### 7.3 Scaling path ("any number of players")

| Stage             | Capacity           | Change                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Single process | ~hundreds          | —                                                                                                     |
| 2. Zone sharding  | ~thousands         | Each zone runs in its own worker/process; gateway routes by player zone; zone hand-off via WorldStore |
| 3. Edge gateways  | ~tens of thousands | Stateless gateways behind a load balancer; sims behind them; sticky sessions per zone                 |

The design constraints that make this possible are already in place: zones are
independent, the sim is single-threaded per zone, and all cross-layer
communication is by message, not shared memory.

---

## 8. Client Architecture

- **Renderer**: a `<div>` grid of monospace `<span>`s (one per tile), updated by
  diffing against the previous frame. Simple, screen-reader-friendly, and fast
  enough for an 80×50 viewport. A Canvas2D renderer can replace it behind the same
  interface (`Renderer.render(view: FrameView)`) if profiling demands it.
- **Input**: keyboard-only (arrows + vi-keys + `g`et, `i`nventory, etc.). Input
  maps to `Command` objects from `shared/protocol` — the client literally cannot
  express an illegal action. **Chat input is modal**: pressing `Enter` opens a
  chat line at the bottom of the screen that captures the keyboard (movement
  keys are suspended); `Enter` sends, `Esc` cancels, `Tab` switches channel.
  The prompt shows the target: `[zone] >` or `[global] >`.
- **State**: the client keeps no game rules, only the last two snapshots + event
  log. All display logic (colors, glyph choice) is pure `view → string` functions,
  unit-tested with jsdom.

## 9. Testing Strategy

Test pyramid, cheapest at the bottom:

| Layer       | Tool       | What                         | Example                                                                               |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | Vitest     | pure rules in `shared`       | `tryMove` into a wall returns `Bumped`, no state change                               |
| Property    | fast-check | rule invariants              | "no entity ever occupies a wall tile", "FOV is symmetric"                             |
| Determinism | Vitest     | replay                       | same seed + same command log ⇒ identical world hash                                   |
| Integration | Vitest     | sim + fake in-memory clients | two players fight; loser dies, winner sees `Died` event                               |
| Integration | Vitest     | gateway chat relay           | zone chat reaches same-zone players only; global reaches all; rate limiter drops spam |
| E2E smoke   | Playwright | real browser ↔ real server   | connect, see `@`, press arrow, `@` moves                                              |

Guidelines:

- **No mocks of `shared`.** The real rules _are_ the test fixture; build small
  worlds with test factories (`makeWorld`, `addGoblin`).
- Fake the network at the gateway seam (`InMemoryTransport`) for integration
  tests — no ports, no flakiness.
- Snapshot-test map generation per seed; a gen algorithm change must be a
  deliberate diff.
- Coverage target: ~100% on `shared/rules`, otherwise pragmatism.
- `pnpm test` runs unit + integration (no browsers needed); `pnpm test:e2e` runs
  the Playwright smoke tests (one-time setup: `pnpm -C packages/e2e exec playwright
  install chromium`). CI runs lint → typecheck → tests.

---

## 10. Linting, Formatting & Type Safety

- **ESLint 9 flat config** (`eslint.config.js` at root) with
  `typescript-eslint` recommended + `eslint-plugin-import`:
  - `import/no-restricted-paths` enforces the `client/server → shared` direction
    and forbids Node/DOM APIs inside `shared`.
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`, `no-unchecked-indexed-access`
    style strictness via tsconfig.
- **Prettier** handles all formatting; `eslint-config-prettier` disables
  conflicting ESLint stylistic rules. One `format` script, checked in CI.
- **tsconfig**: `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
  `noImplicitOverride`. `tsconfig.base.json` extended per package with the right
  `lib` (`DOM` for client, Node types for server, neither for shared).
- **Pre-commit**: `simple-git-hooks` + `lint-staged` → eslint --fix + prettier on
  staged files; `tsc --noEmit` per package in CI.

---

## 11. Developer Workflow

```bash
pnpm install          # bootstrap all workspaces
pnpm dev              # server (tsx watch) + client (vite) concurrently
pnpm test             # vitest unit + integration across workspaces (excludes e2e)
pnpm test:e2e         # Playwright smoke tests (needs playwright install first)
pnpm lint / pnpm format
pnpm build            # type-check all packages + bundle the client
```

Client dev server proxies `/ws` to the local server, so `pnpm dev` is the only
command needed to play locally. Multiplayer testing = open two browser tabs.

---

## 12. Deployment (v1)

### 12.1 Topology

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Browser] -->|HTTPS + WSS, port 443| B[Reverse proxy<br/>Caddy or nginx]
    B -->|static files| C[(client dist/)]
    B -->|plain HTTP/WS<br/>127.0.0.1:3000| D[Node game server<br/>systemd service]
```

One Linux box, three concerns:

1. **Reverse proxy** on ports 80/443 — the only thing exposed to the internet.
2. **Node process** bound to `127.0.0.1:3000` — never directly reachable.
3. **Static client** — the Vite build output, served by the proxy.

### 12.2 TLS & certificates

TLS is effectively mandatory: browsers block `ws://` from `https://` pages
(mixed content), so the socket must be `wss://`. **The proxy terminates TLS;
Node speaks plain HTTP/WS on localhost** — never terminate TLS in Node (cert
renewal, performance, and config all get worse).

| Option                      | Verdict                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Caddy**                   | Default choice. Automatic Let's Encrypt issuance + renewal, WebSocket proxying works out of the box |
| **nginx + certbot**         | Fine, more moving parts                                                                             |

### 12.3 Reverse proxy configs

Caddy (entire config — certs are automatic):

```
game.example.com

root * /srv/game/client/dist
@ws path /ws
reverse_proxy @ws 127.0.0.1:3000
file_server
```

nginx equivalent — note the two things everyone forgets: the `Upgrade` headers
and the read timeout (default 60s kills long-lived game sockets):

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name game.example.com;
    # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key via certbot

    root /srv/game/client/dist;

    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;      # required for WebSocket
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";       # required for WebSocket
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600s;                    # don't kill idle game connections
    }
}
```

The client derives its socket URL from the page origin
(`wss://<host>/ws`), so the same build works in every environment.

### 12.4 Process management: systemd

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/game-server.service
[Unit]
Description=Game server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=game                          # non-root
WorkingDirectory=/srv/game/server
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node dist/index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
Environment=NODE_ENV=production PORT=3000 HOST=127.0.0.1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

systemd gives boot-start, crash-restart, and journald logs for free. A Docker
image with `--restart=always` behind the same proxy is an equally valid
alternative — pick based on the deploy pipeline, not the topology. Kubernetes
is premature for a single-zone stateful sim.

### 12.5 Operational notes

- **Firewall**: only ports 80/443 open; 3000 bound to loopback only.
- **Serverless/edge does not fit**: a stateful in-memory world with long-lived
  sockets needs a real long-running process.
- **Deploys**: connections are stateful, so deploy by draining — stop accepting
  new connections, save the world, restart, clients auto-reconnect (the reconnect
  path from the roadmap makes this seamless).
- **No database yet**: world resets on restart until the `WorldStore` interface
  gains a persistent implementation — no game code changes required.
- **Scaling later** (roadmap phase 4): sticky sessions per zone at the proxy,
  Cloudflare or similar in front for DDoS mitigation.

## 13. Phased Roadmap

1. **Walking skeleton** — connect with a handle, spawn as `@`, move on one
   static map, see another player move, chat. Proves protocol, tick loop,
   renderer, gateway relay, CI.
2. **Roguelike core** — procgen zones, FOV, monsters with AI, melee combat,
   death/respawn, message log. All rules in `shared`, fully unit-tested.
3. **Depth** — items, inventory, stairs between zones, energy/speed tuning.
4. **Scale-out** — persistence behind `WorldStore`, zone sharding, second gateway.
5. **Polish** — interpolation smoothing, reconnect, spectator mode, binary
   protocol if bandwidth demands it.

Each phase ends playable. The walking skeleton is deliberately tiny — everything
else is additive on top of seams that already exist.
